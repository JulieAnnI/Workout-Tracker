  ## Description
  
  This project allows you to view create and track daily workouts. You can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. It can track the name, type, weight, sets, and duration. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, distance traveled will be tracked. As of now, it is still a work in progess, there is some connection issues between Mongodb and Heroku making deployment difficult and adding new exercises is not currently working. These are changes I will be making the future.
